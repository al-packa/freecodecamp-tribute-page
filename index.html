<p class="bio-par">Jackson Pollock is a painter and abstract expressionist from Cody, Wyoming. His most famous paintings are from the "drip period" which spanned from 1947-1950. Pollock laid his canvas on the floor and moved across it (known as "action painting"), throwing and smearing colored paint. Demand for Pollock's work grew, and in 1949, he was featured in a Life magazine article that queried, "Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?" 
    <br><br>
Pollock, who struggled with alcoholism, died in a drunk-driving accident in 1956. He was only 44 years old.
    <br><br>
    Despite his early passing, Pollock's legacy lived on. His paintings have been sold for millions of dollars, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_17A" target="_blank">Number 17A (1948)</a> fetching $200 million in 2016.
